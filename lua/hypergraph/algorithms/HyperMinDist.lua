-- DirectedHypergraph algorithm: computes the minimal distance of all vertices from a given subset.
--
-- Given:
-- * sourceSet: subset of source vertices.
-- * v: a vertex.
-- * e: an edge.
-- this algorithm computes minimal distances as follow:
-- * d(v) = 0 if v belongs to sourceSet
-- * d(e) = 1 + max{d(v) | v belongs to e.inbound}
-- * d(v) = min{d(e) | v belongs to e.outbound}
--
-- Said in another way: This algorithm computes distances in a breadth-first search. An argument controls
-- whether edges are crossed when any vertex of their input set is reached, or to wait until all vertices
-- of the input sets are reached.
